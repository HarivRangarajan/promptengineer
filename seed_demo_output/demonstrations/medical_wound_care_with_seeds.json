Then, gently rinse the wound with clean, lukewarm water. If there is debris, you can use a sterile saline solution or mild soap to help clean it, but avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol as they can irritate the tissue. Pat the area dry with a clean, soft towel or let it air dry before applying a new bandage.\"\n\nWhy this is correct: The response provides a direct answer to the patient's question, offers a step-by-step guide for cleaning the wound, emphasizes the importance of preventing infection (hand washing), and includes practical advice on what solutions to use and avoid. It ensures the patient understands how to safely and effectively clean the wound.\n\nDescription: Demonstrates a direct, practical response to a patient question with clear steps and safety emphasis, avoiding common cleaning mistakes.\n\nStructure Notes: Format: Question -> Direct answer -> Step-by-step guidance -> Safety note -> Practical tip -> Explanation of correctness",
