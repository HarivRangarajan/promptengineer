# PromptEngineer Library - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The **PromptEngineer** library is a modular Python library for automated prompt engineering and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. The library is designed to help users create optimized prompts using research-backed techniques and includes a contextual bandit system for learning and optimization.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The library follows a clean, modular architecture:

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Modular Technique System**
- ✅ `BaseTechnique` class for easy extension
- ✅ `TechniqueRegistry` for managing techniques
- ✅ Chain of Thought fully implemented with meta-prompts
- ✅ Placeholder techniques ready for your research papers

### 2. **Meta-Prompt Generation**
- ✅ Each technique generates meta-prompts (15-20 sentences) describing the approach
- ✅ LLM calls use meta-prompts to generate actual prompts
- ✅ Separate meta-prompts for task prompts and judge evaluation prompts

### 3. **LLM-as-a-Judge Integration**
- ✅ `JudgeGenerator` creates evaluation prompts automatically
- ✅ Multiple scoring methods (1-5 scale, pass/fail, categorical)
- ✅ Automatic criteria extraction and validation
- ✅ Complete evaluation workflow

### 4. **Contextual Bandit Optimization**
- ✅ `ContextualBandit` learns which techniques work best
- ✅ Feature extraction from task context (domain, complexity, etc.)
- ✅ Epsilon-greedy exploration with decay
- ✅ Performance tracking and state persistence

### 5. **Easy Integration with Existing Pipeline**
- ✅ Works with your medical wound-care data
- ✅ Can load existing prompts from CSV
- ✅ Integrates with current LLM-as-a-Judge system
- ✅ Provides feedback loop for optimization

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from promptengineer import PromptGenerator, JudgeGenerator

# Initialize
generator = PromptGenerator(api_key="your-key")
judge_generator = JudgeGenerator(api_key="your-key")

# Create context
context = generator.create_context(
    task_description="Guide patients through wound care procedure",
    domain="medical",
    constraints=["Cannot see visual elements", "Must be safe"]
)

# Generate Chain of Thought prompt
prompt = generator.generate_prompt(context, technique="chain_of_thought")

# Generate corresponding judge prompt
judge_prompt = judge_generator.generate_judge_prompt(
    context=context,
    technique_to_evaluate="chain_of_thought"
)
```

### Auto-Selection with Contextual Bandit
```python
from promptengineer import ContextualBandit

bandit = ContextualBandit()

# Auto-select best technique based on context
technique = bandit.select_technique(context)
prompt = generator.generate_prompt(context, technique=technique)

# After evaluation, provide feedback
evaluation_score = 0.85
bandit.update_reward(evaluation_score)
```

### Medical Wound Care Example
The library includes a complete example (`examples/medical_wound_care.py`) that demonstrates:
- Loading your existing prompts from `data/prompts.csv`
- Generating improved Chain of Thought prompts
- Creating LLM-as-a-judge evaluation prompts
- Using contextual bandits for optimization
- End-to-end workflow integration

## 🔬 Research Integration Ready

The library is designed for easy integration of new research papers:

### For Chain of Thought (Already Implemented)
- ✅ Meta-prompt captures CoT principles (step-by-step reasoning, explicit thinking)
- ✅ Judge meta-prompt evaluates reasoning quality, logical flow, completeness
- ✅ Works with your medical domain examples

### For Your Upcoming Papers
- 🚧 `ChainOfThoughtlessnessTechnique` - placeholder ready for implementation
- 🚧 `ChainOfDraftTechnique` - placeholder ready for implementation
- ✅ Easy to add new techniques by inheriting from `BaseTechnique`

### Integration Process
When you provide papers, we can:
1. Analyze the core technique principles
2. Create 15-20 sentence meta-prompts describing the technique
3. Create corresponding judge evaluation meta-prompts
4. Register the technique in the system
5. Update contextual bandit to learn when to use it

## 🎛️ Configuration & Extensibility

### Custom Techniques
```python
class MyTechnique(BaseTechnique):
    def get_meta_prompt(self, context):
        return f"""Expert prompt engineer instructions for {self.name}..."""
    
    def get_judge_meta_prompt(self, context):
        return f"""Evaluation criteria for {self.name}..."""

generator.register_custom_technique(MyTechnique())
```

### Contextual Features
The bandit automatically extracts features:
- Domain (medical, legal, technical, etc.)
- Task complexity (based on description analysis)
- Presence of examples
- Number of constraints
- Target audience type
- Task type (reasoning, classification, generation)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- ✅ Basic functionality tests pass
- ✅ All modules import correctly
- ✅ Technique registry works
- ✅ Meta-prompt generation functional
- ✅ Compatible with your existing data format

## 🔄 Integration with Your Current Pipeline

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r promptengineer/requirements.txt`
2. **Add API key**: Set your OpenAI API key
3. **Run example**: `python promptengineer/examples/medical_wound_care.py`
4. **Integrate with your pipeline**: Use the library with your existing evaluation system
5. **Add research papers**: Send the papers for Chain of Thoughtlessness and Chain of Draft implementation
